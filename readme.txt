Hi, I'm your projects showcase plugin for WordPress. Use me to show off a portfolio of your latest work.

== Description ==

"Projects" by WooThemes is a clean and easy-to-use project showcase management system for WordPress. Load in your recent projects, and display them on a specified page using our template system, or via a shortcode, widget or template tag.

== Usage ==

Once installed you can begin adding projects right away via the 'Projects' item in the main menu. The interface for adding projects is very similar to adding posts so you should feel right at home. But before you do that you should go ahead and create a page for your projects (via the Pages menu item) and specify that page as your projects base page in the projects settings.

== Installation ==

Installing "Projects" can be done either by searching for "Projects" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org.
2. Upload the ZIP file through the "Plugins > Add New > Upload" screen in your WordPress dashboard.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
